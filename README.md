# Pyonkee

## Overview
[Pyonkee](http://softumeya.com/pyonkee/en/) is a visual-programming language running on iPad. It is based on Scratch from the MIT Media Laboratory.

Pyonkee has been developed from [the open-source code of "Scratch 1.4"](http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Scratch_1.4_Source_Code) from MIT. Since Pyonkee is fully compatible with Scratch 1.4, millions of existing Scratch projects can be used for reference. 

Pyonkee's user interface is optimized for touch interfaces. We do not need a cumbersome typing, even a mouse. Just program wherever you like. Pyonkee nicely supports pinch-in/out display, font scaling for small devices. Moreover, sound recorder and camera are provided for importing your sounds and pictures into the projects. We can mix various media on Pyonkee and program them. 

## History
Pyonkee was originally started as a fork of [John M McIntosh](https://www.smalltalkconsulting.com)'s Scratch Viewer - [Scratch.app.for.iOS](https://github.com/johnmci/Scratch.app.for.iOS). While Scratch Viewer just works as a viewer of the existing Scratch projects, Pyonkee supports creation/edit of projects.

### Other major modifications from the viewer:
 - User interfaces are optimized for iPad (Viewer supports both iPhone and iPad)
 - Native font support
 - Embedded camera support
 - IME support
 - Auto-saving project
 - Sending/Receiving projects via e-mail
 - Project import/export through iTunes (currently disabled on AppStore version)
 - Prokect sharing via AirDrop (since version 1.9)
